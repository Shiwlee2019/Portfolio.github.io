<h3>Project</h3>
<p>
In my Software Engineering class, I worked with a team to build a Personal Habit Tracker web application. Our goal was to help users stay organized and motivated by tracking their personal and professional goals. The app features reminders, a visual planner, habit streak tracking, and motivational badges. I contributed to the backend logic and helped design a clean, user-friendly interface using Java, HTML/CSS, and MySQL. This project taught me how to collaborate using GitHub, communicate ideas clearly, and turn user needs into functional features.
